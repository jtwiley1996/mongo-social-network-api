## Description
My Social Network API is a project designed to explore network API workings using MongoDB. It's inspired by a vision of creating a platform for users to freely share thoughts, connect with friends, and express reactions. This endeavor has deepened my understanding of API design, CRUD operations, reaction and friendship management, and MongoDB's data modeling, system architecture, and user-centric design principles. It's been a valuable learning experience that underscores the significance of databases in real-world applications.
